Testing Report: What each test case is testing

test1.sql: Error handling for insert. All sql commands should return error codes.
           Also a general select all statement to ensure nothing is in the database

test2.sql: General insert commands. Tried to insert with order of attributes changed.
           General select all statement to check that all inserts have worked.

test3.sql: Insert commands when multiple relations are present. Alternating
           inserts between the two relations. General select all statements
           to ensure that both relations contain all inserted tuples

test4.sql: Basic selection tests. Tried to scan select with a variety of operators.
           Created indexes and tried to index select (and ensure that scan selects
           were still chosen when appropriate. Ensured that outputting duplicate 
           values wasn't a problem when projecting. 

test5.sql: More selection tests. Make sure that it can handle multiple indexes
           on the same relation and ensure that the index can handle duplicates.

test6.sql: Basic selects and joins on a large database. Ensure that inl join
           works regardless of which relation contains the index. Also, ensure
           that joining on the projected attributes aren't a problem for inl, snl,
           and smj.

test7.sql: Test inl, snl, and smj with duplicates present. Ensure that complete
           list of matching tuples is present.

test8.sql: Test directed towards smj. First check to see if it can handle no 
           common values, and then duplicates in various orders to ensure 
           correctness in edge cases.
